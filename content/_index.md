    content: >
      I am a Software Professional, MSc Student, oldest sibling, outdoors lover,
      and a wellbeing enthusiast. Currently I am focusing on modern software
      development and technical writing. My aspiration is to become an
      influencer in the field of software. Outside of work and studying, you can
      find me from outside walking, enjoying nature or maybe doing some
      forest/farm work with my uncle and father.
