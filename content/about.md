**Joonas Ryyn√§nen** is a Software & DevOps Architect from Kontiolahti, Finland. During his Computer Science studies in the LUT University, he has worked in multiple companies gaining relevant experience in DevOps and modern web development. He has also worked as a freelance consultant and a start-up entrepreneur.

Joonas is interested in improving the software development workflow via different DevOps practices. He recognizes that the process of software development is knowledge work - it is everybody's benefit when the software environment at a software project is pleasant to work on.

His hobbies include playing the piano and the PlayStation, and enjoying the nature. Sometimes he visits his uncle's farm where it is possible to do something completely different than software development.
